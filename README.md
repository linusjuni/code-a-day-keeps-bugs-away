Crafting coding expertise through consistent practice

## What's this about?

I'm solving coding problems every day to get better at programming. Recently, I have felt cognitive fade-away, where I let a lot of my problems be solved by LLM's. I want to change that: **This repo is about me writing code myself - no AI assistance, no copy-pasting solutions.** That's why right now, I don't worry too much about having the fastest solution - I just want to write code myself that works and solves the problem.

## My approach

1. Read the problem
2. Think of a simple solution that works
3. Write the code
4. Make sure it solves the problem
5. Move on to the next one

No overthinking, no perfect optimization, no shortcuts - just me solving problems and building the habit of thinking through code on my own ðŸ˜Ž
